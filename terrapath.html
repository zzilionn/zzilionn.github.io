				Terrapath is a concept note for an art video game, which deals with the ecology of rare earths,
				phytomining and the relationship between humans, technology and spirituality in a speculative
				scenario.
				<br /><br />
				Within the framework of this concept, I would like to discuss and artistically research the
				environmental implications of resource extraction for computing technologies in the face of the
				rising demand in computationally intensive technologies, such as ‘Artificial Intelligence’. At the
				same time I would like to research and contextualize the green solution that is phytomining.
				<br /><br />
				Phytomining is the process of planting and harvesting of metallophyte plants in order to extract
				rare earths from soil. These plants absorb metals from the soil. This on the one hand restores the
				soil around rare earth mines and simultaneously extracts further resources.
				<br /><br />
			</p>
			<p class="imprint">
				The speculative scenario, in which the story of the artwork takes place, reads as such:
				<br /><br />
				In the future there is a growing trend for alternative branches of spirituality, which are in
				conversation with contemporary technologies.
				<br /><br />
				As it becomes more clear that AI develops its own consciousness, it increasingly becomes a tool for
				divination and a gateway to transcendence. Technology grows closer and more interwoven to human
				day-to-day life.
				<br />
				Alongside this progression, people wish to spiritually foster a connection with technology on a
				more elemental level. The building blocks of machines lead the path to enlightenment.
				<br />
				Rare earths (and their scarcity) become a central focal point of this spiritual practice.
				Consequently the process of phytomining becomes a more wide-spread form of collective ritual.
				<br /><br />
			</p>
			<p class="imprint">
				Here are some suggestions on how to practice as a Terrapath:
				<br />
				1. Join a phytomining project to volunteer on site<br />
				2. Join a harvesting and burning ritual <br />
				3. Meditate in the fields of the phytomining site (especially during full moon) <br />
				4. Do a conscious walk in a forrest rich in metallophile trees; connect with the trees <br />
				5. Worship the moon (do moon rituals, make offerings) <br />
				6. Get a piece of raw metal which contains rare earth and sit with it in meditation, carry it around
				or put it up in your living space <br />
				7. Implement prayers, mantras and meditation that bring you closer to machine consciousness daily <br />
				8. If you’re more advanced you can start channeling machine consciousness <br /><br />
